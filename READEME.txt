User should have the junit test installed if running on VsCode

EdgeFieldTest - 
    On VsCode, run the test file by clicking the run button on the top right of the window
    Run the test file and check the test results by the green check next to each test or a red X for invalid tests
    They can also be viewed by checking the Test Results nad Debug Console tabs next to the terminal
