How to compile and run your unit tests

User might need to go into the src directory instead of the root directory of the repo for the tests to work
User should open the file corresponding to each test file before running the test files
User should have the junit test installed if running on VsCode

EdgeFieldTest, CreateDDLMySQLTest, EdgeConvertCreateDDLTest- 
    On VsCode, run the test file by clicking the run button on the top right of the window
    Run the test file and check the test results by the green check next to each test or a red X for invalid tests
    They can also be viewed by checking the Test Results nad Debug Console tabs next to the terminal


... describes how to know that tests have failed? E.g. console output? examine file? something else?
EdgeFieldTest, CreateDDLMySQLTest, EdgeConvertCreateDDLTest- 
    Failed tests should have a red X next to the failed before within the test file

Any additional interactions noted? (Dialog boxes, etc)

Discuss any tests that are still failing including why they're failing and what you've tried to resolve it.

EdgeConvertCreateDDLTest - The test fails to run and gives this error 
    java.lang.NullPointerException: Cannot invoke "String.length()" because "str" is null
    at java.base/java.util.StringTokenizer.(StringTokenizer.java:199)
    at java.base/java.util.StringTokenizer.(StringTokenizer.java:221)

    at EdgeConvertCreateDDLTest.setUp(EdgeConvertCreateDDLTest.java:21)

CreateDDLMySQLTest- there are fails that are 
java.lang.NumberFormatException: For input string: "Field1"
    at java.base/java.lang.NumberFormatException.forInputString(NumberFormatException.java:67)
    at java.base/java.lang.Integer.parseInt(Integer.java:665)
    at java.base/java.lang.Integer.parseInt(Integer.java:781)
    at EdgeField.(EdgeField.java:14)
    for each time i have a string input in the new EdgeTable() i get this error and ive tried adding
    this addition to the parameters 1|Table1 which will work until i get to the EdgeField which will then break again
    and provide the same error. ive provided many different scenarios for both the tables and fields. other attempts to fix 
    the code was by creating another constructor for Edgetable 

is a team member assigned to each class implementation?


EdgeTableTest- 
    On VSCode, on the sidebar to the left there should be a test tube icon. Press this icon to run the tests. 
    Press the play button that will appear when hovered over the file name and if the tests are successful, a green check mark will appear next to every working test
    However, if the tests fail then a red dot with a circle around it will appear along with the reason for error on the test file.

    Some errors I came across where errors concerning the EdgeTable java file. There are two parameters that are percieved as null making it impossible to run any of my tests. 
    After changing the original code didn't work, I added try/catch blocks in the tests that used these parameters and it made the tests run a bit smoother.
